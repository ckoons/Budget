# Budget Component Implementation Progress

## Overview

The Budget component is being implemented as part of the Budget Consolidation Sprint, which aims to combine the token allocation capabilities from Apollo with the cost tracking functionality from Rhetor into a unified budget management system for Tekton.

## Completed Components

### 1. Project Structure and Setup
- Created directory structure following the Tekton component pattern
- Implemented package configuration (setup.py, requirements.txt)
- Created component initialization files
- Added run script (run_budget.sh)
- Updated README with component documentation

### 2. Core Data Models
- Implemented comprehensive domain models based on the architectural decisions
- Combined token-based and cost-based tracking in a unified model
- Added proper validation and business rules
- Created data transfer objects for API communication
- Implemented debug instrumentation

Components:
- `/Budget/budget/data/models.py` - Core domain entities
- `/Budget/budget/core/constants.py` - Default configuration values

### 3. Storage Layer
- Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM models for persistence
- Created migration functionality for schema creation
- Implemented repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Added database connection management
- Added data initialization for default values

Components:
- `/Budget/budget/data/db_models.py` - ORM models
- `/Budget/budget/data/repository.py` - Repository interfaces

### 4. Budget Engine Core
- Implemented budget allocation system for token management
- Created budget policy enforcement for limit management
- Developed usage tracking for detailed monitoring
- Added reporting and analysis capabilities
- Implemented model recommendation system

Components:
- `/Budget/budget/core/allocation.py` - Allocation management
- `/Budget/budget/core/engine.py` - Core budget functionality
- `/Budget/budget/core/policy.py` - Policy enforcement
- `/Budget/budget/core/tracking.py` - Usage tracking

### 5. Hermes Integration & Single Port Architecture
- Implemented Hermes service registration and heartbeat
- Updated port configuration to use BUDGET_PORT (8013)
- Implemented path-based routing following Single Port Architecture pattern
- Added health check endpoint
- Created comprehensive integration documentation

Components:
- `/Budget/budget/utils/hermes_helper.py` - Hermes registration utility
- `/Budget/budget/api/app.py` - Updated FastAPI application with Hermes registration
- `/MetaData/ComponentDocumentation/Budget/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Integration documentation

## Components in Progress

### 1. MCP Protocol Support
- Need to implement MCP protocol endpoints for standardized communication
- Will include message handlers for budget operations
- Need to register MCP capabilities with Hermes

### 2. WebSocket Support
- Need to implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
- Will include notification system for budget alerts
- Need to create client-side WebSocket consumer example

### 3. Price Source Adapter Framework
- Need to implement framework for fetching pricing data from external sources
- Will include adapters for LiteLLM, LLMPrices.com, and Pretrained.ai
- Need to implement price verification system
- Need to add scheduling for automatic updates

## Components Not Yet Started

### 1. CLI Interface
- Need to implement command-line interface for Budget component
- Will include commands for budget management, reporting, and configuration

### 2. MCP Protocol Support
- Need to implement Multi-Component Protocol support
- Will include message handlers and event publishing
- Need to implement Hermes registration

### 3. Budget LLM Assistant
- Need to implement LLM-based budget assistant
- Will include optimization suggestions and recommendations
- Need to create prompt templates and agent functionality

### 4. Basic Dashboard Components
- Need to implement API endpoints for dashboard data
- Need to create basic UI components for budget visualization

## Integration Points

### 1. Apollo Integration
- Need to create adapter for Apollo integration
- Will include migration utilities for existing Apollo budgets

### 2. Rhetor Integration
- Need to create adapter for Rhetor integration
- Will include migration utilities for existing Rhetor budgets

## Next Steps

1. Implement API endpoints for Budget component
2. Implement price source adapter framework
3. Create CLI interface
4. Implement MCP protocol support
5. Create integration adapters for Apollo and Rhetor
6. Implement Budget LLM assistant
7. Create basic dashboard components

## Implementation Notes

- The Budget component combines token allocation from Apollo with cost tracking from Rhetor
- The implementation follows domain-driven design principles
- All components include debug instrumentation following Tekton guidelines
- The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns
- The system supports both token-based and cost-based budgeting
- The implementation includes automated price monitoring and verification
- The component includes budget-aware routing and model selection
